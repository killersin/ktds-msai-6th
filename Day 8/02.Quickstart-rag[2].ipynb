    "# RAG Quickstart for Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart provides a query for RAG scenarios. It demonstrates an approach for a chat experience using grounding data from a search index on Azure AI Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a few shortcuts to keep the exercise basic and focused on query definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the **hotels-sample-index**, which can be created in minutes and runs on any search service tier. This index is created by a wizard using built-in sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We omit vectors so that we can skip chunking and embedding. The index contains plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-vector index isn't ideal for RAG patterns, but it makes for a simpler example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand the fundamentals of integrating queries from Azure AI Search to a chat completion model on Azure OpenAI, you can build on that experience by adding vector fields and vector and hybrid queries. We recommend the [phi-chat Python code example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/phi-chat/phi-chat.ipynb) for that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is fully documented in [Quickstart: Generative search (RAG) with grounding data from Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-rag). If you need more guidance than the readme provides, please refer to the article.\n"
